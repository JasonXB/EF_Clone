  When I moved to Canada, a country so prosperous filled with seemingly endless opportunities, I discovered that resilience is a universal need through many heartfelt conversations with Canadians about their daily struggles. They felt trapped and lost, and their mental health was affected. And, as rates of suicide, domestic violence, and drug addiction rose, I was inspired to make a positive change. 
  
  Resilience is a skill best learned, but it's always harder when you have to do it alone. With a support system that propels you forward when you fall back, it makes the road less daunting. A little-known fact is that support systems are within reach to us all, in the communities around us; those that are willing to embrace others and share experiences, to grow as a collective. 
  
  Our country's youth is now facing a future filled with uncertainty, and guidance is a privilege that is not accessible to all. In this era, where we are bombarded with the double-edged sword that is social media, I'm reminded of the need for community; to instill resilience in the beautiful hearts and minds of our youth.
  
  I saw firsthand the ability of mentorship to nurture resilience with those I freely mentored over the years, and in 2013, I was encouraged to pass along my wisdom even further; laying the roots for Empowered Futures. 
  
  To empower the future of our youth, we must give them the resources — and unwavering support — that they need to tackle this world. One person can't offer this alone; it requires collaborating with the best in our local community to make sure our future leaders can thrive in the face of adversity.
  
  I have met tactful people over the years from every walk of life; talented, and full of passion to give back. Empowered Futures is an organization being built from the ground up by these individuals, working together to make the world a little more manageable, and a little less scary, for the generation that will soon be leading it.
  
  My vision for Empowered Futures is to plant the seeds and watch them grow to heights we never thought possible. I hope you'll join us for the journey.
